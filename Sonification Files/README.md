Second attempt used python script ('pix_vals to frequencies.py') to count number of dark pixels and number of light pixels in an image. Then for each image, vary the volume of the garageband tracks according to the relative amount of light and dark areas. ('Sonification space apps 2 (1).mp3')

There are three tracks playing simultaneously for each image:

* Piano - this represents brighter parts of the image
* Timpani - this represents the darker parts of the image
* Cymbal - this represents the greys.

Final video is 'James Solar Sonification.mp4'
