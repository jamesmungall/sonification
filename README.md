## This project consists of three seperate parts that all take nasa data and interpret it in varying audio/visual formats. 
* A solar simulation that uses visuals and audio to understand where planets are and how they orbit. 

* A solar sonification tool that goes over each pixel and converts it to audio creating an experience of moving across the surface of the sun, pixel by pixel.

* A solar sonification pipeline that takes whole images of the sun and creates a small piece of music based on the pixel intensity data of the whole image.
