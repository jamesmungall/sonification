### This project consists of three seperate parts that all take nasa data and interpret it in varying audio/visual formats. 
The aim was to present ways that we could diversify data interpretation and bring it to life in new ways that focused on accessibilty. For example we thought about people who are visually impared and how we could use different aspects of the resources we had to create different ways of experiencing images taken of the sun. 

* A solar simulation that uses visuals and audio to understand where planets are and how they orbit. (Solar simulation files) The project, in unity, gives a walk through of our solar system with both sound and image showing how the planets interact. The audio in particular adds a spacial dimension to the walk through so that even while you can't see the planets that are orbiting around where you are, you can still hear them and understand where they are in relation to where you are in the walkthrough. 

* A solar sonification tool that goes over each pixel and converts it to audio creating an experience of moving across the surface of the sun, pixel by pixel. (Sonification files)

* A solar sonification pipeline that takes whole images of the sun and creates a small piece of music based on the pixel intensity data of the whole image.  (Histogram creation tool and Suns_as_songs)
